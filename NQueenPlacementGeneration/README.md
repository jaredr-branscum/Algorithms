# N Queen Problem Placement Generation Algorithm
Input: integer *N* for *N* x *N* board

Output: Return the # of all possible placements of *N* objects on *N* x *N* board

Time Complexity: O( 2 <sup>*N*<sup> 2</sup></sup> ) where *N* = dimensions of the board and number of objects placed on the board

## Constraints
* No two objects can be placed in the same cell on the *N* x *N* board
* All *N* objects must be placed on the *N* x *N* board

## Future Work
* Implement Parallelization for faster performance
* Generate placements for *K* objects placed on *N* x *N* board
* Generate placements of *K* objects placed for *N*-cube
